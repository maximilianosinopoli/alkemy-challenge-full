# Alkemy Challenge

#### This is the project that I developed to apply for [Alkemy].
#### Alkemy is a training platform where trainee software developers accelerate and certify their skills to become Job-ready developers. The training takes place in practice labs that simulate real-life work environments. The program is designed for developers who know how to code but have no work experience.
