# Alkemy Challenge

 #### This is the project that I developed to apply for [Alkemy](https://www.alkemy.org/).
 
<p>Alkemy is a training platform where juniors software developers accelerate and certify their skills during a six-week project. The training takes place in practice labs that simulate real-life work environments.</p>

<h3>How run the project</h3>

<p>Install dependencies with running `nmp i`</p>
<p>For the Frontend, CD client folder and run `npm start`</p>
<p>For the API, CD server folder and run `npm run dev`</p>
